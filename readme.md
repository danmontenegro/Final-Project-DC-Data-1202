## Introduction 

This code aims to analyze the the frequency of mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health per Country. We used a dataset provided by Open Source Mental Illness related to mental health survey.


## Explanation

To perform this analysis, we identified the amount of people that answer yes to the following question:
"Have you sought treatment for a mental health condition?"

With this information, we identified the number of people that declared to be in treatment per country and plotted it to better visualize. In the visual we can see that United Stated is by far the Country with more yes answers, followed by United Kingdon.

Other analyze provided regards to the number of people that answered that their Companies do provide mental health benefits. 
With this variable we got the top 10 Countries that have more Companies that provide this kind of benefits and also used visualizations. The Countries that show up in the top were also USA and UK.

Finally, we analyzed how is percentage of people that have this type of benefit  versus all people interviewed by country. This analsyis  indicates that Norway and The Bahamas are in the lead, with 100% of people covered with benefits, even though their samples just got one answer. The followwing Countries are USA and Croatia, with 53% and 50% respectively.
